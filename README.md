This report was prepared for Megaline, a telecommunication service provider, in order to see their customers' usage behaviour. Megaline has 2 different calling plans: Surf and Ultimate.

In this report you will find the analysis on the following:
1. Usage behaviour on different services (calls, messages, and internet).
2. The comparison of usage behaviour between the two plans.
3. Revenue based on the above, as well as hypotheses testing as to whether the average profits from the two plans differs.
4. Another hypotheses testing on whether selected regions differ in the average profits they generate.

T-Test from Python Scipy was used to carry out the hypothesis tests.
